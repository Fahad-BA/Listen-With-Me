# SongsSicrept ;
* it's free to use as you like ;
* you have to create DB & table named "Songs" with these cloumns :
* ID (int/AI) , Song (TEXT) , YouTube (TEXT) , SoundCloud (TEXT) ;
* if you used it give me your link so I'll get proud my program got your attention ;
# PS:
* It's an old project I created it back then in high school, I'm not ashamed of how many bugs and how awful its design is.
* I will create a similar one with Laravel soon.
